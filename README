Problem Description/Specification:
    Create a program with the provided specification files that can use those files to create methods that read external files,
    interpret the data and use the user input to implement Dijkstras shortest distance algorithm. 

Client Algorithm:
    The algorithm of the client file has access to background methods created in the specification file. The client files main 
    algorithm deals with actually finding the external file and the functions used to interpret the data.The Graph class contains 
    methods such as addVertex, IsMarked, IsEmpty, and IsFull. 

Dijkstra's Algorithm:
    Dijkstra's Algorithm is known as the best (greedy) search algorithm with a run time of O(E log v) for all cases. Simply, it 
    is used to find the shortest paths betweeen each vertex in a graph and is commonly used in GPS. A table is a common representation 
    of the implementation of the algorithm to visually show the algorithms implementation on each set of data. The algorithm focuses on 
    the name of the vertex, the shortest distance to get to that vertex, and the vertex that was visited before it. The distance to each vertex is integral to 
    find the shortest path. The algorithm checks all possible connected vertices and adds the distance from the previous vertex to get the total/shortest
    distance to each vertex

    An example of Dijkstra's algorithm implemented on travel between US Cities:
